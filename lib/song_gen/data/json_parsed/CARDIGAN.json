{"ARTIST": "TAYLOR", "SONG_TITLE": "CARDIGAN", "LYRICS": "Vintage tee, brand new phone\n\nHigh heels on cobblestones\n\nWhen you are young, they assume you know nothing\n\nSequin smile, black lipstick\n\nSensual politics\n\nWhen you are young, they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you\n\nDancin' in your Levis\n\nDrunk under a streetlight, I\n\nI knew you\n\nHand under my sweatshirt\n\nBaby, kiss it better, I\n\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan\n\nUnder someone's bed\n\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nA friend to all is a friend to none\n\nChase two girls, lose the one\n\nWhen you are young, they assume you know nothin'\n\nBut I knew you\n\nPlaying hide-and-seek and\n\nGiving me your weekends, I\n\nI knew you\n\nYour heartbeat on the High Line\n\nOnce in 20 lifetimes, I\n\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan\n\nUnder someone's bed\n\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nTo kiss in cars and downtown bars\n\nWas all we needed\n\nYou drew stars around my scars\n\nBut now I'm bleedin'\n\n'Cause I knew you\n\nSteppin' on the last train\n\nMarked me like a bloodstain, I\n\nI knew you\n\nTried to change the ending\n\nPeter losing Wendy, I\n\nI knew you\n\nLeavin' like a father\n\nRunning like water, I\n\nAnd when you are young, they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss\n\nI knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs\n\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long\n\n'Cause I knew everything when I was young\n\nI knew I'd curse you for the longest time\n\nChasin' shadows in the grocery line\n\nI knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired\n\nAnd you'd be standin' in my front porch light\n\nAnd I knew you'd come back to me\n\nYou'd come back to me\n\nAnd you'd come back to me\n\nAnd you'd come back\n\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan\n\nUnder someone's bed\n\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\n\n"}
