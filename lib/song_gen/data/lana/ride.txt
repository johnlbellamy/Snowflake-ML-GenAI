I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time, daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time, baby
Hot or cold
Don't break me down (don't break me down)
I've been travelin' too long (I've been travelin' too long)
I've been trying too hard (I've been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (with one pretty song)
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road doves do it, ride 'til dark
Don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
Don't say good bye (don't say good bye)
Don't turn around (don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (leave me high and dry)
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
All I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
