(Got that?)\n\nFeet don't fail me now\n\nTake me to the finish line\n\nOh, my heart it breaks every step that I take\n\nBut I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine\n\nWalking through the city streets\n\nIs it by mistake or design?\n\nI feel so alone on the Friday nights\n\nCan you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?\n\nIt's like I told you, honey (louder)\n\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\n\nSometimes love is not enough\n\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\n\nKeep making me laugh\n\nLet's go get high\n\nThe road is long, we carry on\n\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\n\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\n\nYou like your girls insane, so (louder)\n\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\nLost but now I am found\n\nI can see that once I was blind\n\nI was so confused as a little child\n\nTryna take what I could get\n\nScared that I couldn't find\n\nAll the answers, honey (louder)\n\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\n\nSometimes love is not enough\n\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\n\nKeep making me laugh\n\nLet's go get high\n\nThe road is long, we carry on\n\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\n\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\n\nYou like your girls insane, so (louder)\n\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\nWe were born to die\n\n(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)\n\nWe were born to die\n\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\n\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\n\nYou like your girls insane\n\nSo, don't make me sad, don't make me cry\n\nSometimes love is not enough\n\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\n\nKeep making me laugh\n\nLet's go get high\n\nThe road is long, we carry on\n\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\n\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\n\nYou like your girls insane, so (louder)\n\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\nWe were born to die\n\n(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)\n\nWe were born to die\n\nWhy?
